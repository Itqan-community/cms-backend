# Deployment Rules Test

**Test Date:** 2024-12-22  
**Test Purpose:** Verify GitHub Actions workflow correctly enforces branch flow rules

## Test Scenarios

### ✅ Valid Flows (Should Pass)
1. `develop → staging` - Development to pre-production
2. `staging → main` - Pre-production to production

### ❌ Invalid Flows (Should Fail)
1. `develop → main` - Direct development to production 
2. `feature-branch → staging` - Feature branch to staging
3. `feature-branch → main` - Feature branch to production

## Test Results

This file was created to test the deployment rules enforcement.
If you can see this file after a PR merge, the workflow is functioning correctly.

**Current Test Status:** Testing in progress...

## Workflow Validation

The GitHub Actions workflow should:
- ✅ Validate branch combinations before deployment
- ❌ Fail with clear error messages for invalid flows
- 🚀 Deploy successfully for valid flows
- 📝 Log all validation attempts
