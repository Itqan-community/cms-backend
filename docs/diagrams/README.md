# Itqan CMS - C4 Architecture Diagrams

This directory contains the complete C4 model architecture diagrams for the Itqan CMS Release 1 MVP system.

## Additional Diagrams
- `high-level-db-components-relationship.png` - Entity Relationship diagram showing core database entities (User, Role, Resource, License, Distribution, AccessRequest, UsageEvent) and their relationships
- `high-level-db-components-relationship.mmd` - Mermaid source for the ER diagram above
- `api-surface-overview.mmd` - API surface design showing endpoints organized by authentication and role requirements

## C4 Model Overview

The C4 model provides a hierarchical way to think about and communicate software architecture through four levels of abstraction:

| Level | Name | Audience | Purpose |
|-------|------|----------|---------|
| **Level 1** | **System Context** | Stakeholders, Business Analysts, Everyone | Shows the system in its environment, who uses it, and external dependencies |
| **Level 2** | **Container** | Architects, Technical Leads | Shows the major containers (apps, services, DBs, APIs) and how they interact |
| **Level 3** | **Component** | Developers, Technical Teams | Zooms into a single container, showing its internal components/modules |
| **Level 4** | **Code/Implementation** | Developers, Implementers | Shows class-level/code structure for developers |

## Diagram Files

### [Level 1: System Context Diagram](./level1-system-context.md)
- **File**: `level1-system-context.md`
- **Shows**: Itqan CMS in its business environment with users and external systems
- **Key Elements**: User types, external integrations (Payment Gateway, Email, CDN, Analytics)

### [Level 2: Container Diagram](./level2-container-diagram.md)
- **File**: `level2-container-diagram.md`
- **Shows**: High-level technical architecture and major system containers
- **Key Elements**: Frontend apps, Backend APIs, Databases, Infrastructure services

### [Level 3: Component Diagram](./level3-component-diagram.md)
- **File**: `level3-component-diagram.md`
- **Shows**: Internal structure of the Content API container
- **Key Elements**: Controllers, Services, Repositories, Middleware, Utilities

### [Level 4: Data Models](./level4-data-models.md)
- **File**: `level4-data-models.md`
- **Shows**: Database schema and entity relationships
- **Key Elements**: Entity definitions, relationships, indexes, constraints

## How to Use These Diagrams

### For Business Stakeholders
Start with **Level 1** to understand:
- Who uses the system and how
- What external services are integrated
- Overall business context and value proposition

### For Architects and Technical Leads
Focus on **Level 2** to understand:
- System boundaries and container responsibilities
- Technology choices and patterns
- Integration points and data flow
- Scalability and deployment considerations

### For Development Teams
Use **Level 3** to understand:
- Internal component structure and responsibilities
- Code organization and module boundaries
- Dependency relationships
- Implementation patterns and practices

### For Implementers
Reference **Level 4** for:
- Database schema design
- Entity relationships and constraints
- Data modeling decisions
- Implementation details

## Mermaid Diagrams

All diagrams are created using Mermaid syntax, which can be rendered in:
- GitHub (native support)
- GitLab (native support)
- VS Code (with Mermaid extension)
- Documentation sites (Docusaurus, GitBook, etc.)
- Online tools (mermaid.live, etc.)

## Architecture Principles

The Itqan CMS architecture follows these key principles:

### Modularity
- Clear separation of concerns across layers
- Microservices pattern for backend APIs
- Component-based frontend architecture

### Scalability
- Stateless service design
- Caching layers (Redis)
- Event-driven architecture with message queues
- CDN for content delivery

### Security
- API Gateway for centralized security
- Permission-based access control
- Input validation at multiple layers
- Secure file storage and handling

### Maintainability
- Clean architecture patterns
- Repository pattern for data access
- Dependency injection
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

### Performance
- Caching strategies at multiple levels
- Search optimization with Elasticsearch
- Background job processing
- Database optimization with proper indexing
