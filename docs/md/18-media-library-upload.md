**Date:** 2025-08-21  
**Author:** Claude AI Assistant  

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive media library system with MinIO integration for file storage, Django models for metadata management, and admin interface for file organization.

## Objectives
- ✅ Django models for media file management
- ✅ MinIO S3-compatible storage configuration
- ✅ Admin interface for file uploads and organization
- ✅ API endpoints for media operations
- ✅ File type validation and metadata extraction

## Implementation Details
- **App Created**: `apps.medialib` with complete media management
- **Models**: MediaFile, MediaFolder, MediaAttachment for hierarchical organization
- **Storage**: MinIO configuration with S3-compatible settings
- **API**: Full CRUD operations with bulk upload support
- **Admin**: Rich admin interface with file previews and statistics

## Key Features
- **File Types**: Support for images, audio, video, documents, archives
- **Metadata**: Automatic extraction of file size, MIME type, dimensions
- **Organization**: Hierarchical folder structure for file organization
- **Validation**: File extension validation and security checks
- **Integrity**: SHA-256 checksums for file verification
- **Attachments**: Link media files to other content models

## Database Models
- **MediaFile**: Core file storage with metadata
- **MediaFolder**: Hierarchical folder organization
- **MediaAttachment**: Generic foreign key relationships

## API Endpoints
- `GET/POST /api/v1/media/files/` - File CRUD operations
- `GET/POST /api/v1/media/folders/` - Folder management
- `POST /api/v1/media/files/bulk_upload/` - Multiple file upload
- `GET /api/v1/media/files/stats/` - Library statistics

## Testing Results
| Test | Method | Outcome |
|---|-----|---|
| Models | Django migrations | ✅ |
| Admin Interface | Django admin access | ✅ |
| API Endpoints | REST API functionality | ✅ |
| MinIO Integration | Storage configuration | ✅ |

## Acceptance Criteria Verification
- [x] MediaFile model with MinIO storage backend
- [x] Admin interface for file uploads and management
- [x] API endpoints for programmatic access
- [x] File metadata extraction and validation
- [x] Folder-based organization system

## Next Steps
Media library is ready for integration with content models and frontend UI development.
