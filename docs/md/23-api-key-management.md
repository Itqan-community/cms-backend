# 23 – API Key Management (ADMIN-006)

**Date:** 2025-01-10  
**Author:** Itqan CMS AI Assistant  

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive API key generation, management, and rate limiting system for Itqan CMS, providing developers secure access to Islamic content APIs with usage analytics, throttling controls, and a sophisticated Angular management interface (ADMIN-006) built with NG-ZORRO components.

## Objectives
- Implement secure API key generation and management for developers accessing Quranic content
- Add intelligent rate limiting middleware to protect API endpoints from abuse
- Create comprehensive developer dashboard (ADMIN-006) for API key management and usage monitoring
- Set up detailed monitoring, logging, and analytics for API usage patterns
- Integrate with existing role-based access control and AccessRequest workflow

## Implementation Details

### Backend Implementation

#### API Key Management System
- **APIKey Model**: Comprehensive model with secure key generation, permissions, IP restrictions, and lifecycle management
- **Secure Key Generation**: Cryptographically secure API keys with SHA-256 hashing and configurable prefixes (itq_test_/itq_live_)
- **Permission System**: Role-based default permissions with granular control per API key
- **Usage Tracking**: Complete APIKeyUsage model for analytics and compliance monitoring
- **Rate Limiting**: Advanced rate limit violation tracking with RateLimitEvent model

#### Authentication & Middleware
- **APIKeyAuthentication**: Custom DRF authentication class supporting Bearer token format
- **APIKeyThrottle**: Sophisticated throttling system with per-key rate limits
- **APIUsageMiddleware**: Comprehensive middleware for request/response logging and analytics
- **IP Restrictions**: Support for IP whitelisting with CIDR notation
- **Automatic Expiration**: Configurable key expiration with days-based lifecycle

#### REST API Endpoints
- **APIKeyViewSet**: Full CRUD operations with stats, revoke, and regenerate actions
- **APIKeyUsageViewSet**: Read-only usage logs with filtering and pagination  
- **RateLimitEventViewSet**: Admin-only rate limit violation monitoring
- **APIKeyStatisticsViewSet**: Global statistics and analytics dashboard

#### Django Admin Integration
- **Custom Admin Interfaces**: Comprehensive admin for API keys, usage logs, and rate limit events
- **Bulk Operations**: Admin actions for batch key revocation
- **Advanced Filtering**: Role-based filtering and search capabilities
- **Usage Analytics**: Built-in statistics and monitoring views

### Frontend Implementation (ADMIN-006)

#### Angular Component Architecture
- **Multi-Tab Interface**: API Keys, Usage Logs, and Rate Limit Events tabs
- **Real-time Statistics**: Global API statistics dashboard with usage metrics
- **Key Management**: Create, edit, regenerate, and revoke API keys
- **Usage Analytics**: Individual key statistics with daily usage charts and top endpoints
- **Security Features**: One-time key display with copy-to-clipboard functionality

#### Key Features Implemented
- **Secure Key Display**: New API keys shown only once with secure modal
- **Advanced Filtering**: Search and filter across all data tables
- **Rate Limit Monitoring**: Real-time rate limit violation tracking
- **Usage Dashboards**: Comprehensive analytics with charts and statistics
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface with Itqan design system
- **Copy Protection**: Secure clipboard integration for API keys

### Security Features
- **Cryptographic Security**: SHA-256 hashing with secrets.token_urlsafe(32)
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable per-key and global rate limits
- **IP Restrictions**: CIDR-based IP whitelisting support
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for all key operations
- **Automatic Revocation**: Admin and self-service key revocation with reasons
- **Secure Storage**: Keys never stored in plaintext, only hashes maintained

## Testing Results
| Test | Method | Outcome |
|---|-----|---|
| API Key Generation | Django Management + API | ✅ |
| Rate Limiting | DRF Throttling System | ✅ |
| Authentication | Bearer Token Validation | ✅ |
| Usage Logging | Middleware Integration | ✅ |

| Angular Component | Component Structure & Styling | ✅ |
| Database Migrations | Applied Successfully | ✅ |

## Acceptance Criteria Verification
- [x] API key generation and management working in Django admin and Angular UI
- [x] Django REST Framework rate limiting active on all public API endpoints
- [x] API key authentication returns proper 401/429 status codes with DRF error format
- [x] Rate limits differentiate between authenticated and public access using DRF throttling
- [x] API usage statistics logged and viewable in Django admin and Angular ADMIN-006 interface
- [x] Angular interface (ADMIN-006) provides comprehensive API key management with NG-ZORRO components
- [x] Complete integration with cms.mdc screen flow and Islamic content management workflow

## Next Steps
1. Implement Task 24: Public Content Pages (PUB-001, PUB-002) with SEO optimization
2. Add advanced rate limiting algorithms (sliding window, token bucket)
3. Integrate API key management with content access request workflow
4. Implement API monetization tracking and usage-based analytics
