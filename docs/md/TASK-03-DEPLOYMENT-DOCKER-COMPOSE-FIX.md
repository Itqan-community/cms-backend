# 03 – GitHub Actions Deployment Docker Compose Fix

**Date:** 2025-01-03  
**Author:** AI Assistant  

## Overview
Fixed GitHub Actions deployment workflow error where the system was looking for a non-existent generic `docker-compose.yml` file. Updated the workflow to use environment-specific Docker Compose files based on the deployment branch.

## Objectives
- Resolve deployment failure in GitHub Actions workflow
- Ensure environment-specific Docker Compose files are used correctly
- Update deployment scripts to match the correct file structure

## Implementation Details
- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Added `COMPOSE_FILE` environment variable that maps to the correct compose file per branch
  - `develop` branch → `docker-compose.develop.yml`
  - `staging` branch → `docker-compose.staging.yml`
  - `main` branch → `docker-compose.production.yml`
- **Deployment Script**: Updated `deploy-develop.sh` to use the specific development compose file
- **Files Modified**:
  - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
  - `deployment/deploy-develop.sh`

## Testing Results
| Test | Method | Outcome |
|---|-----|---|
| Workflow Logic | Code Review | ✅ |
| Compose File Mapping | Branch Logic Verification | ✅ |
| Script Updates | File Path Validation | ✅ |

## Acceptance Criteria Verification
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow uses environment-specific compose files
- [x] Deployment script updated to match file structure
- [x] All docker-compose commands use the correct file path
- [x] Environment variables properly set for each branch

## Next Steps
1. Test actual deployment on next push to develop branch
2. Monitor deployment logs to ensure containers start correctly
3. Verify health checks pass with new configuration
