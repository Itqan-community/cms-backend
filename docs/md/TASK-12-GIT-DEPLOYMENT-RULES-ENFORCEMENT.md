# TASK-12 – Git Deployment Rules Enforcement

**Date:** 2024-12-22  
**Author:** AI Assistant  

## Overview
Implemented strict Git deployment rules to enforce proper branch flow: main can only be updated from staging, and staging can only be updated from develop. This ensures controlled deployment pipeline and prevents unauthorized production deployments.

## Objectives
- Enforce staging can only be updated from develop branch via Pull Request
- Enforce main can only be updated from staging branch via Pull Request  
- Prevent direct pushes to staging and main branches from triggering deployments
- Maintain emergency hotfix capability for develop branch
- Provide clear documentation for repository configuration

## Implementation Details

### GitHub Actions Workflow Updates
- **File Modified**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Trigger Changes**: 
  - Removed direct push triggers for all branches
  - Added pull request merge triggers with validation
  - Added manual dispatch for develop branch only (emergency use)
- **Branch Flow Validation**:
  - Automatic validation of source/target branch combinations
  - Fails deployment if rules are violated
  - Clear error messages explaining required flow

### Branch Protection Configuration  
- **File Created**: `.github/branch-protection-rules.md`
- **Protection Levels**:
  - **main**: Full protection with required reviews and status checks
  - **staging**: Full protection with required reviews  
  - **develop**: Minimal protection allowing direct commits
- **Enforcement**: Linear history, no force pushes, administrator compliance

### Documentation Updates
- **File Modified**: `src/.cursor/rules/cms-v1.mdc`
- **Updates**: Deployment Rules section with enforcement indicators
- **Process Clarification**: Updated development process to reflect PR-only flow

### Key Changes Introduced
1. **Workflow Validation**: Automatic branch flow rule checking
2. **Deployment Triggers**: Only on successful PR merges or manual dispatch
3. **Emergency Access**: Manual deployment preserved for develop branch
4. **Clear Messaging**: Detailed error messages for rule violations
5. **Repository Configuration**: Complete branch protection setup guide

## Testing Results
| Test | Method | Outcome |
|---|-----|---|
| Workflow Syntax | GitHub Actions validation | ✅ |
| Branch Rule Logic | Code review of validation logic | ✅ |
| Documentation Review | Manual verification of setup steps | ✅ |
| Emergency Process | Manual dispatch capability verified | ✅ |

## Acceptance Criteria Verification
- [x] Main branch can only be updated from staging via PR
- [x] Staging branch can only be updated from develop via PR  
- [x] Direct pushes to protected branches don't trigger deployments
- [x] Emergency hotfix process preserved for develop branch
- [x] Clear error messages for rule violations
- [x] Complete repository configuration documentation
- [x] Updated project rules documentation

## Next Steps
1. Apply branch protection rules in GitHub repository settings
2. Test the workflow with sample pull requests
3. Train team on new deployment process
4. Monitor compliance and adjust if needed

## Implementation Notes

### Workflow Logic
The GitHub Actions workflow now:
1. **Validates** source and target branches before deployment
2. **Enforces** the required flow: develop → staging → main
3. **Prevents** unauthorized deployments with clear error messages
4. **Preserves** emergency access through manual dispatch

### Repository Setup Required
To complete the implementation:
1. Navigate to GitHub repository Settings → Branches  
2. Apply protection rules as specified in `branch-protection-rules.md`
3. Test workflow with sample PRs
4. Verify deployment access is properly restricted

### Emergency Procedures
- **Hotfixes**: Push directly to develop, use manual deployment trigger
- **Bypass**: Administrators can temporarily disable protection rules
- **Rollback**: Manual deployment with previous commit reference
