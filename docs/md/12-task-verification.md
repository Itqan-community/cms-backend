## Overview
Task 12 (User Registration) was already fully implemented but had incorrect status tracking. The implementation includes complete Auth0 integration, REG-001 wireframe-matching UI, Django backend integration, and comprehensive testing.

## Verification Results
| Component | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Frontend REG-001 | ✅ Complete | `frontend/src/app/features/auth/register.component.ts` |
| Auth0 Integration | ✅ Complete | AuthService with registration flow |
| Django Backend | ✅ Complete | Auth0UserService user creation |
| Documentation | ✅ Complete | `docs/md/12-user-registration.md` |
| Testing | ✅ Complete | All acceptance criteria verified |

## Status Update
- **Before**: tasks.csv showed "todo" status
- **After**: Updated to "completed" status
- **Reason**: Implementation was complete but tracking was outdated

## Next Steps
Task 12 is complete. Next logical task would be:
- **Task 13**: Email Verification (REG-002 screen)
- **Task 14**: User Login (AUTH-001 screen)
- **Task 15**: Token Exchange Loading (AUTH-002 screen)
