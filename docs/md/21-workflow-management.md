# 21 – Workflow Management (ADMIN-004)

**Date:** 2025-01-10  
**Author:** Itqan CMS AI Assistant  

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive workflow management system for editorial content approval, enabling Publishers to submit Quranic resources for review and Reviewers/Admins to approve, reject, or publish content through a structured five-state workflow with complete audit trail and notification system.

## Objectives
- Build editorial approval workflow with status tracking: Draft → In Review → Reviewed → Published/Rejected
- Implement backend workflow API endpoints with role-based permissions
- Create ADMIN-004 Angular component with workflow status tracking interface
- Integrate comprehensive UI with NG-ZORRO components following Itqan design system

## Implementation Details

### Backend Implementation
- **Enhanced Resource Model**: Added workflow status fields (`workflow_status`, `reviewed_by`, `reviewed_at`, `review_notes`, `submitted_for_review_at`) with five-state workflow choices
- **Workflow Methods**: Implemented transition methods (`submit_for_review`, `approve_review`, `reject_review`, `publish_resource`, `reset_to_draft`) with validation and notifications
- **API Endpoints**: Created `WorkflowViewSet` with actions for all workflow transitions and `workflow_permissions` endpoint
- **Permission Classes**: Added `IsPublisherOwnerOrReviewer` and `IsReviewerOrAdmin` for role-based access control
- **Migrations**: Generated and applied database migrations for new workflow fields

### Frontend Implementation (ADMIN-004)
- **Angular Component**: Created comprehensive workflow management component with tabs for different workflow states
- **Dashboard Statistics**: Real-time workflow statistics display with role-based views
- **Interactive Tables**: Resource listings with status-specific actions and review capabilities
- **Modal Integration**: Review modals with timeline display and note management
- **NG-ZORRO Integration**: Full use of Ant Design components (nz-table, nz-tabs, nz-modal, nz-timeline, nz-statistic)

### Files Modified/Created
- `backend/apps/content/models.py` - Enhanced Resource model with workflow fields and methods
- `backend/apps/content/views/workflow.py` - New WorkflowViewSet with transition actions
- `backend/apps/api/permissions.py` - New permission classes for workflow access control
- `backend/apps/api/urls.py` - Registered workflow endpoints
- `frontend/src/app/features/admin/workflow-management/` - Complete Angular component directory
- Applied content model migrations
