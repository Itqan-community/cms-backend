# TASK-14 – Django Admin Cleanup

**Date:** 2025-09-04  
**Author:** AI Assistant  

## Overview
Successfully configured Django admin interface to show only custom project models by hiding all third-party package models (allauth, wagtail, django.contrib, etc.). The admin interface now provides a clean, focused view showing only the CMS-specific models that administrators need to manage.

## Objectives
- Hide third-party models from Django admin interface  
- Maintain visibility of all custom project models
- Create a clean, focused admin experience
- Ensure the solution is maintainable and extensible

## Implementation Details
### Core Admin Configuration (`src/apps/core/admin.py`)
- Created comprehensive `AdminConfig` class to manage model visibility
- Implemented automatic detection and unregistration of third-party models
- Added support for allauth, wagtail, taggit, and Django contrib models
- Built robust error handling for missing models

### App Integration (`src/apps/core/apps.py`)
- Modified `CoreConfig.ready()` method to load admin configuration
- Ensured cleanup runs after all apps are loaded
- Added final cleanup to catch any late-registered models

### Management Command (`src/apps/core/management/commands/cleanup_admin.py`)
- Created `cleanup_admin` management command for manual execution
- Added `--show-stats` flag to display current registration state
- Included `--dry-run` option for testing without changes
- Provided detailed output for monitoring and debugging

### Key Features
- **Automatic Detection**: Identifies third-party models by app label
- **Selective Unregistration**: Only removes non-custom models
- **Error Resilience**: Handles missing models gracefully
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Supports all major third-party packages
- **Maintainable Design**: Easy to extend for new packages

## Testing Results
| Test | Method | Outcome |
|---|-----|---|
| Admin Cleanup Command | `python manage.py cleanup_admin --show-stats` | ✅ Successfully removed 10 third-party models |
| Server Health Check | `curl http://localhost:8000/health/` | ✅ Server running normally |
| Admin Interface Load | Django runserver + admin access | ✅ Only shows custom models |

### Models Successfully Hidden
- `auth.group` (Django contrib)
- `sites.site` (Django contrib)  
- `account.emailaddress` (allauth)
- `account.emailconfirmation` (allauth)
- `socialaccount.socialapp` (allauth)
- `socialaccount.socialaccount` (allauth)
- `socialaccount.socialtoken` (allauth)
- `wagtailimages.image` (wagtail)
- `wagtaildocs.document` (wagtail)
- `taggit.tag` (taggit)

### Models Kept Visible (27 total)
- **accounts**: role, user
- **analytics**: legacyusageevent  
- **api_keys**: apikey, apikeyusage, ratelimitevent
- **content**: asset, assetaccess, assetaccessrequest, assetversion, distribution, license, publishingorganization, publishingorganizationmember, resource, resourceversion, usageevent
- **licensing**: accessrequest, legacylicense
- **medialib**: mediaattachment, mediafile, mediafolder
- **search**: indexingtask, searchconfiguration, searchindex, searchmanagement, searchquery

## Acceptance Criteria Verification
- [x] Third-party models are hidden from Django admin interface
- [x] All custom project models remain visible and accessible
- [x] Admin interface loads without errors
- [x] Solution is maintainable and extensible
- [x] Management command available for manual execution
- [x] Comprehensive testing completed

## Next Steps
1. Document admin access procedures for new team members
2. Consider adding role-based admin permissions for different user types
3. Monitor admin interface performance with large datasets

## References
- Admin interface accessible at: `http://localhost:8000/django-admin/`
- Management command: `python manage.py cleanup_admin --show-stats`
- Configuration files: `src/apps/core/admin.py`, `src/apps/core/apps.py`
