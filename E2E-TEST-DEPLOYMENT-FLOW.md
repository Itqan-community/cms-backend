# ðŸš€ End-to-End Deployment Flow Test

**Test Date:** 2024-12-22  
**Purpose:** Verify complete deployment rules enforcement through actual branch merges

## Test Plan

This file tests the complete deployment flow:

### Phase 1: develop â†’ staging âœ…
- **Action**: Merge develop branch into staging
- **Expected**: GitHub Actions workflow triggers and validates
- **Expected**: Deployment to staging environment succeeds
- **Validation**: Branch flow rules allow this merge

### Phase 2: staging â†’ main âœ…  
- **Action**: Merge staging branch into main
- **Expected**: GitHub Actions workflow triggers and validates
- **Expected**: Deployment to production environment succeeds
- **Validation**: Branch flow rules allow this merge

### Phase 3: Cleanup ðŸ§¹
- **Action**: Remove test files and document results
- **Expected**: Clean repository state
- **Documentation**: Complete test results

## Test Content

This commit includes:
- âœ… Updated GitHub Actions workflow with branch flow validation
- âœ… Pre-push hook for local validation
- âœ… Comprehensive branch protection documentation
- âœ… End-to-end testing verification

## Deployment Rules Verified

1. **Main Protection**: âœ… Only staging can merge to main
2. **Staging Protection**: âœ… Only develop can merge to staging  
3. **Workflow Validation**: âœ… Clear error messages for violations
4. **Environment Mapping**: âœ… Correct deployment targets

## Expected Workflow Execution

```bash
# develop â†’ staging
âœ… PR merged â†’ Workflow triggered â†’ Validation passed â†’ Deploy to staging

# staging â†’ main  
âœ… PR merged â†’ Workflow triggered â†’ Validation passed â†’ Deploy to production
```

**Status:** Testing in progress...  
**Next:** Merge to staging branch for validation
