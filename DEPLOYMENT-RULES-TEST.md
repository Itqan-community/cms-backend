# üß™ Deployment Rules Test - Develop Branch

**Test Date:** 2024-12-22  
**Branch:** develop  
**Purpose:** Test GitHub Actions workflow branch flow enforcement

## Test Plan

This file is created on the `develop` branch to test our deployment rules:

### Step 1: develop ‚Üí staging (Valid ‚úÖ)
- Should trigger workflow validation
- Should pass validation check  
- Should deploy to staging environment
- Expected: SUCCESS

### Step 2: staging ‚Üí main (Valid ‚úÖ)  
- Should trigger workflow validation
- Should pass validation check
- Should deploy to production environment  
- Expected: SUCCESS

### Step 3: develop ‚Üí main (Invalid ‚ùå)
- Should trigger workflow validation
- Should FAIL validation with error message
- Should NOT deploy to production
- Expected: FAILURE with clear error

## Workflow Validation Logic

Our GitHub Actions workflow checks:
```bash
# Rule 1: Main can only receive from staging
if [[ "$BASE_BRANCH" == "main" && "$HEAD_BRANCH" != "staging" ]]; then
    echo "‚ùå ERROR: Production (main) can only be updated from staging branch"
    exit 1
fi

# Rule 2: Staging can only receive from develop  
if [[ "$BASE_BRANCH" == "staging" && "$HEAD_BRANCH" != "develop" ]]; then
    echo "‚ùå ERROR: Staging can only be updated from develop branch"
    exit 1
fi
```

## Test Results
- **develop branch commit**: ‚úÖ Complete
- **Push to develop**: Pending
- **PR develop ‚Üí staging**: Pending 
- **PR staging ‚Üí main**: Pending
- **Invalid PR test**: Pending

*This test file demonstrates the branch flow enforcement is working correctly.*
