# TASKS 7-10 â€“ ACCESS CONTROL, ANALYTICS, MIGRATION & VALIDATION

**Date:** 2024-12-19  
**Author:** AI Assistant  

## Overview
Successfully completed Tasks 7-10 implementing comprehensive access control models, analytics tracking, database migration strategy, and model relationship validation. These tasks established the foundation for user access management, usage analytics, and validated the complete ERD implementation.

## Objectives
- **Task 7:** Implement AssetAccessRequest and AssetAccess models with auto-approval workflow
- **Task 8:** Create UsageEvent and Distribution models for analytics and content delivery
- **Task 9:** Assess database state and create comprehensive migration strategy
- **Task 10:** Validate all foreign key relationships and constraints match ERD specifications

## Implementation Details

### Task 7: Access Control Models
#### Key Components Created:
- **AssetAccessRequest model**: Complete request workflow with auto-approval
- **AssetAccess model**: Access grants with license snapshots and expiration
- **Auto-approval workflow**: V1 implementation with immediate access
- **Business logic methods**: Request creation, approval, rejection, validation

#### Access Control Features:
```python
# Auto-approval workflow
request, access = AssetAccessRequest.request_access(
    user=user,
    asset=asset, 
    purpose="Development testing",
    intended_use="non-commercial",
    auto_approve=True
)

# Access validation
has_access = AssetAccess.user_has_access(user, asset)
user_access = AssetAccess.get_user_access(user, asset)
```

#### Database Tables Created:
- `asset_access_request`: User access requests with approval workflow
- `asset_access`: Granted access with license snapshots and download URLs

### Task 8: Analytics and Distribution Models
#### Analytics Implementation:
- **UsageEvent model**: Tracks downloads, views, API access
- **Distribution model**: Multiple content delivery channels
- **Event tracking methods**: Asset/resource downloads, views, API calls
- **Analytics aggregation**: User stats, asset stats, resource stats

#### Event Tracking Features:

```python
# Track different event types
UsageEvent.log_asset_download(user, asset, ip_address, user_agent)
UsageEvent.log_asset_view(user, asset, ip_address, user_agent)
UsageEvent.log_resource_download(user, resource, ip_address, user_agent)
UsageEvent.log_api_access(user, resource, api_endpoint, ip_address, user_agent)

# Get analytics
user_stats = UsageEvent.get_user_stats(user)
asset_stats = UsageEvent.get_asset_stats(asset)
```

#### Distribution Channels:
```python
# Create distribution channels
Distribution.create_rest_api_distribution(resource, endpoint_url, version)
Distribution.create_zip_distribution(resource, download_url, version)
Distribution.create_graphql_distribution(resource, graphql_endpoint, version)
```

#### Database Tables Created:
- `usage_event`: Analytics tracking with conditional foreign keys
- `distribution`: Content delivery channels with access configuration

### Task 9: Database Migration Strategy
#### Migration Assessment:
- **Current state analysis**: Evaluated existing data and relationships
- **Migration readiness**: Identified transformation requirements
- **Safe migration approach**: Phased migration with rollback capability

#### Assessment Results:
```
ðŸ“Š Current Record Counts:
   Users                    :     2 records
   PublishingOrganization   :     2 records
   License                  :     5 records
   Resource                 :     1 records
   ResourceVersion          :     6 records
   Asset                    :     1 records
   UsageEvent               :     7 records
   Distribution             :     3 records
```

#### Migration Tasks Identified:
1. Create PublishingOrganizations from publisher Users
2. Create PublishingOrganizationMember records
3. Convert Resource.publisher to Resource.publishing_organization
4. Create ResourceVersion for each Resource (v1.0.0)
5. Ensure all Resources have default_license
6. Link Assets to ResourceVersions through AssetVersion
7. Validate all foreign key relationships

### Task 10: Model Relationships Validation
#### Validation Results:
- **User â†” PublishingOrganization**: Many-to-many through intermediate model âœ…
- **Organization â†’ Resource**: One-to-many with PROTECT constraint âœ…
- **Resource â†’ ResourceVersion**: One-to-many with CASCADE, is_latest constraint âœ…
- **License relationships**: PROTECT constraints on all license references âœ…
- **Asset relationships**: Complex multi-model relationships working âœ…
- **Access control**: OneToOne AssetAccessRequest â†” AssetAccess linkage âœ…

#### Constraint Testing:
- **Unique constraints**: Preventing duplicate access requests âœ…
- **CASCADE behavior**: Proper deletion cascading âœ…
- **PROTECT behavior**: License deletion protection âœ…
- **Foreign key integrity**: All relationships validated âœ…

#### Performance Validation:
```
âš¡ Query Performance Results:
   Assets with org & license: 53.62ms
   Access requests with users & assets: 8.88ms
   Basic counts: 6.22ms
   Filtered queries: 3.70ms
   Resources with orgs, licenses & versions: 9.62ms
```
