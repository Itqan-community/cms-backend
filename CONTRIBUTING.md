## 🤝 Contributing

Thank you for helping improve Quranic accessibility. This guide keeps contributions smooth, consistent, and aligned with our workflow.

## 🧭 Branch Strategy
- **Protected branches**: `main`, `staging` (PRs only; no direct commits)
- **Active development**: `develop` (direct commits allowed)
- **Flow**: `develop` → `staging` (PR) → `main` (PR). Do not skip stages.
- **Features**: branch from `develop` as `feature/<short-description>`

## 🛠️ Workflow
1) Start from `develop` or a `feature/*` branch
2) Make small, focused commits with clear messages
3) Test locally; fix linter/type errors
4) Push to `origin/develop` or open a PR from `feature/*` to `develop`
5) Request review; address feedback; keep PRs concise

## 🧰 Development Setup
- Python 3.13+
- Docker (recommended) or native setup
- See `README.md` → Quick Start

## 🧪 Testing
- Use `pytest` (not `manage.py test`)
- Follow Arrange–Act–Assert (AAA)
- Name tests: `test_<function_name>_where<criteria>_should<expected_results>`

## 📦 API & Errors
- APIs: Django Ninja; document responses
- 400s: `apps.core.ninja_utils.errors.ItqanError`
- 403s: `rest_framework.exceptions.PermissionDenied`
- Document errors with `NinjaErrorResponse` when applicable

## 🧹 Style & Quality
- Python 3.13, Django 5.2 compatible
- Type hint all functions
- Prefer `AwareDateTime` in Schemas
- Avoid unnecessary try/except; keep control flow clear

## 🚦 CI/CD & Deployment
- GitHub Actions enforce branch flow and protections
- Deployments run only on successful PR merges to protected branches
